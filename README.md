#*teensy* chrome extension for changing the link in google docs to a link to the drive home

So small, you can read all of it, build it yourself, and never fear that it is doing anything messy! 

Google is doing very clever things underneath the actual editor in docs, which make it harder to extend the functionality through a chrome extension. Working paragraph collapse and more functionality will have to be made by extending docs through the Drive SDK, which makes more sense.
